# HZ Her Astronomy Project
This was a project developed to determine how long the variable star system HZ Her (composed of a neutron star and a main sequence star) revolves around itself. Methods used include fourier analysis and data collection from remote telescopes. Done with the correspondence of the AAVSO (American Association of Variable Star Observers).
